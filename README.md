# Awesome Cloud Dev

> Cloud R & D is a closed-loop + coded software development all in the cloud. It allows business people, developers, operators, etc. to work together in the same cloud to transparently complete the entire software life cycle (features, design, coding, construction, deployment, operations), rather than isolated from each other, or With multiple software to get the job done.
